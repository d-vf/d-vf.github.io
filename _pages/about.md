I am a PhD Student in Engineering and Public Policy at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/) and [Carnegie Mellow University](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/index.html) under the [CMU Portugal Program](https://cmuportugal.org/). 

I am working on *Enabling secure and distributed electricity markets and operations in low-voltage electricity networks*. advised by [Carlos Santos Silva](https://in3.dem.ist.utl.pt/team/members/carlos-santos-silva/), [Nicolas Christin](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/) and [Soummya Kar](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/kar-soummya.html)

I worked on several energy-related topics, besides legal and regulatory matters (usually with some intersection with technology) and, I am at [*Industrial Ecology and Sustainability*](https://in3.dem.ist.utl.pt/laboratories/industrial-ecology-and-sustainability/) at [IN+ Center for Innovation, Technology and Policy Research](https://in3.dem.ist.utl.pt/) / [Laboratory of Robotics and Engineering Systems (LARSyS)](https://groups.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~larsys.daemon/).

I am also a jurist with a Master in Law and management ([Universidade Nova de Lisboa](https://www.unl.pt/)) and a Law Degree ("Licenciatura em Direito").
